## Space Sim

This is (so far) a basic Space Sim.  You run the program and can left-click to add objects to the screen.  These objects will be affected by each other's gravity and will fly around the screen.  Collisions will make them bigger.  Going offscreen makes them appear on the other side.


### Dependencies

Raylib 4.5.*
Any C++ compiler
